I love following technology, exploring linux, portable devices, networking, SIP/VOIP, lifehacks, gadgets, IPAs, porters, and stouts.

I don't build massive gaming rigs (and typically don't play computer games). When I do build or upgrade computers I'm usually more interested in performance per watt, idle power consumption, and noise levels. Just because I'm interested in those doesn't mean it happens. I like to reuse what is available and serves the purpose rather than throw out to waste.

Current gadgets:

  * Moto X (2014) - Love the Moto Display feature but don't love the camera
  * Amazon Fire TV (it was free)
  * Acer C720 Chromebook - Celeron 2955U Haswell
  * Asus X202e laptop - i3-3217U Ivy Bridge (running Windows 10 but plan to switch to Fedora 23 shortly)
  * HP Pavilion dv6 laptop - i7-3610QM Ivy Bridge (running Fedora 22 but plan to switch to Windows 10)

Gadgets under consideration:

  * Phones
    * LG Nexus 5X - f/2.0 aperture 12.3 MP sensor 1.55µm pixel size (can this be used to get sensor size?)
    * Huawei Nexus 6P - same rear camera, better front shooter
    * Lumia 950 XL (has glance screen!) - Carl Zeiss optics f/1.9 aperture 20MP (1/2.4") sensor PureView software
    * Blackberry Priv
    * LG V10 - likely very pricey
  * Tablets
    * Jolla Tablet
  * Laptops
    * Surface Book

Old gadgets:
	
  * HTPC (Atom ION 330) with Ubuntu 9.10 using XBMC and Boxee beta
  * Nokia e71  (ARM1136J(F)-S)
  * Samsung Galaxy S (Captivate)
  * Nokia 701
  * Desktop with Ubuntu (specs posted [here](http://www.knurdtech.com/cheap-desktop-upgrade/))
  * Core 2 Duo T5500 Laptop with Archbang Linux
  * Moto X (original)
  * Nokia Lumia 920
  * LG Nexus 5
  * Blackberry Z10
